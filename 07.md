# Guards

Wherever a pattern occurs (``let``, ``case``, ``receive``, ``lc``, etc.) it 
can be followed by an optional guard which has the form ``(when test ...)``.
Guard tests are the same as in vanilla Erlang and can contain the
following guard expressions:

* ``(quote e)``
* ``(cons gexpr gexpr)``
* ``(car gexpr)``
* ``(cdr gexpr)``
* ``(list gexpr ...)``
* ``(tuple gexpr ...)``
* ``(binary ...)``
* ``(progn gtest ...)`` - Sequence of guard tests
* ``(if gexpr gexpr gexpr)``
* ``(type-test e)``
* ``(guard-bif ...)`` - Guard BIFs, arithmetic, boolean and comparison 
   operators

An empty guard, ``(when)``, always succeeds as there is no test which
fails. This simplifies writing macros which handle guards.
