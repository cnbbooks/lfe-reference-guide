# ETS and Mnesia

Apart from ``(emp-record ...)`` macros for ETS Match Patterns, which are
also valid in Mnesia, LFE also supports match specifications and Query
List Comprehensions. The syntax for a match specification is the same
as for ``match-lambdas``:

```lisp
(match-spec
  ((arg ... ) {{(when e ...)}} ...) ;; Matches clauses
  ... )
```
For example:

```lisp
(ets:select db (match-spec
                 (((tuple _ a b)) (when (> a 3))
                   (tuple 'ok b))))
```

It is a macro which creates the match specification structure which is
used in ``ets:select`` and ``mnesia:select``. The same ``match-spec``
macro can also be used with the dbg module. The same restrictions as to 
what can be done apply as for vanilla match specifications:

* There is only a limited number of BIFs which are allowed
* There are some special functions only for use with dbg
* For ets/mnesia it takes a single parameter which must a tuple or a
  variable
* For dbg it takes a single parameter which must a list or a variable

**NOTE**: The current macro neither knows nor cares whether it is being
used in ets/mnesia or in dbg. It is up to the user to get this right.

Macros, especially record macros, can freely be used inside match
specs.

**CAVEAT**: Some things which are known not to work in the current
version are ``andalso``, ``orelse`` and record updates.
