# Extended cond

``cond`` has been extended with the extra test ``(?= pat expr)`` which tests
if the result of ``expr`` matches ``pat``. If so, it binds the variables in 
``pat`` which can be used in the ``cond``. An optional guard is allowed 
here.

An example:

```lisp
(cond ((foo x) ...)
      ((?= (cons x xs) (when (is_atom x)) (bar y))
       (fubar xs (baz x)))
      ((?= (tuple 'ok x) (baz y))
       (zipit x))
      ... )
```
