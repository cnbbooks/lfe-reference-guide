# Bindings and Scoping

LFE is a Lisp-2 and has separate namespaces for variables and
functions/macros. Both variables and functions/macros are lexically
scoped. Variables are bound by ``lambda``, ``match-lambda`` and ``let``. 
Functions are bound by top-level ``defun``, ``flet`` and ``fletrec``.
Macros are bound by top-level ``defmacro``/``defsyntax`` and by 
``macrolet``/``syntaxlet``.

When searching for functions, both name and arity are used. A macro is
considered to have any arity and will match all functions with that
name. While this is not consistent with either Scheme (or CL) it is
simple, usually easy to understand, and fits Erlang quite well. It
does, however, require using ``(funcall func arg ... )`` like CL to call
``lambdas``/``match-lambdas`` ``(funs)`` bound to variables.

Core solves this by having separate bindings and special to
have only one apply:

* ``apply _F (...)``, and
* ``apply _F/3 ( a1, a2, a3 )``
