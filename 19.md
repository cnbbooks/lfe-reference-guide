# List/binary comprehensions

List/binary comprehensions are supported as macros. The syntax for
list comprehensions is:

```lisp
(lc (qual  ...) expr ... )
```

where the final ``expr`` is used to generate the elements of the list.

An alias is provided such that the following is also valid:

```lisp
(list-comp (qual  ...) expr ... )
```

The syntax for binary comprehensions is:

```lisp
(bc (qual  ...) expr ... )
```

where the final expr is a bitseg expr and is used to generate the
elements of the binary.

An alias is provided such that the following is also valid:

```lisp
(bin-comp (qual  ...) expr ... )
```


The supported qualifiers, in both list/binary comprehensions are:

| Form | Notes |
| -- | -- |
| ``(<- pat {{guard}} list-expr)`` | Extract elements from a list expression |
| ``(<= bin-pat {{guard}} binary-expr)`` | Extract elements from a binary/bits expression|
| ``(?= pat {{guard}} expr)`` | Match test and bind variables in ``pat`` |
| ``expr`` | Normal boolean test |

Some examples:

```lisp
(lc ((<- v (when (> v 5)) l1)
     (== (rem v 2) 0))
  v)
```

That returns a list of all the even elements of the list ``l1`` which are
greater than ``5``.

```lisp
(bc ((<= (f float (size 32)) b1)  ; No wrapping, only bitseg needed
     (> f 10.0))
  (io:fwrite "~p\n" (list f))
  (f float (size 64)))            ; No wrapping, only bitseg needed
```

That returns a binary of floats of size 64 of floats which are larger than
``10.0`` from the binary ``b1`` and of size ``32``. The returned numbers 
are first printed.

**NOTE**: A word of warning when using guards when extracting elements 
from a binary.  When a match/guard fails for a binary no more attempts 
will be made to extract data from the binary. This means that even if a
value could be extracted from the binary, if the guard fails, this value
will be lost and extraction will cease. This is **NOT** the same as
having following boolean test which may remove an element but will not
stop extraction. Using a guard is probably not what you want!

Normal vanilla Erlang does the same thing but does not allow guards.
