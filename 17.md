Binaries/bitstrings
-------------------

A binary is

(binary seg ... )

where seg is
        byte
        string
        (val integer|float|binary|bitstring|bytes|bits
             (size n) (unit n)
             big-endian|little-endian|native-endian|little|native|big
             signed|unsigned)

Val can also be a string in which case the specifiers will be applied
to every character in the string. As strings are just lists of
integers these are also valid here. In a binary constant all literal
forms are allowed on input but they will always be written as bytes.
