# Binaries/bitstrings

A binary is

```cl
(binary seg ... )
```

where ``seg`` is:

```cl
    byte
    string
    (val integer|float|binary|bitstring|bytes|bits
         (size n) (unit n)
         big-endian|little-endian|native-endian|little|native|big
         signed|unsigned)
```

``val`` can also be a string in which case the specifiers will be applied
to every character in the string. As strings are just lists of
integers these are also valid here. In a binary constant all literal
forms are allowed on input but they will always be written as bytes.
