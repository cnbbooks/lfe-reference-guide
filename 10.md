# Function shadowing

Unqualified functions shadow as stated previously. This results in the
following order within a module, outermost to innermost:

* Predefined BIFs (same as in vanilla Erlang)
* Predefined LFE BIFs
* Imports
* Top-level defines
* Flet/fletrec

This means that it is perfectly legal to shadow BIFs by imports,
BIFs/imports by top-level functions and BIFs/imports/top-level by
``fletrecs``. In this respect there is nothing special about BIfs, they
just behave as prefined imported functions, a whopping big ``(import
(from erlang ...))``. EXCEPT that we know about guard BIFs and
expression BIFs. If you want a private version of ``spawn`` then define
it, there will be no warnings.

**CAVEAT**: This does not hold for the supported core forms. These can be
shadowed by imports or redefined but the compiler will **always** use
the core meaning and never an alternative. Silently!
