# Patterns

Written as normal data expressions where symbols are variables and use
quote to match explicit values. Binaries and tuples have special syntax.

| Erlang | LFE |
| -- | -- |
| ``{ok,X}`` | ``(tuple 'ok x)`` |
| ``error`` | ``'error`` |
| <code>{yes,[X|Xs]}</code> | ``(tuple 'yes (cons x xs))``|
| ``#m(k v ... )`` | Map constants, ``k`` ``v`` are keys and values |
| ``[ ... ]`` | Allowed as alternative to ``( ... )`` |
| 0:6 | 1:6 |

```erlang

```

```cl

```

                   -> 
            -> 
<<34,F/float>>          -> (binary 34 (f float))
[P|Ps]=All              -> (= (cons p ps) all)

Repeated variables are *NOT* supported in patterns, there is no
automatic comparison of values. It must explicitly be done in a
guard.

_ as the "don't care" variable is supported. This means that the
symbol _, which is a perfectly valid symbol, can never be bound
through pattern matching.

Aliases are defined with the (= pattern1 pattern2) pattern. As in
Erlang patterns they can be used anywhere in a pattern.

*CAVEAT* The lint pass of the compiler checks for aliases and if they
are possible to match. If not an error is flagged. This is not the
best way. Instead there should be a warning and the offending clause
removed, but later passes of the compiler can't handle this yet.
