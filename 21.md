# Query List Comprehensions

LFE supports QLCs for mnesia through the qlc macro. It has the same
structure as a list comprehension and generates a Query Handle in the
same way as with ``qlc:q([...])``. The handle can be used together with
all the combination functions in the module qlc.

For example:

```lisp
(qlc
  (lc ((<- (tuple k v) (ets:table e2)) (== k i)) v) {{Option}})
```
Macros, especially record macros, can freely be used inside query list
comprehensions.

**CAVEAT**: Some things which are known not to work in the current
 version are nested QLCs and ``let``/``case``/``recieve`` which shadow 
 variables.
