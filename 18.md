Maps
----

A map is:

(map key value ... )

To access maps there are the following forms:

(map-get map key)

        Return the value associated with key in map.

(map-set map key val ... )

        Set keys in map to values.

(map-update map key val ... )

        Update keys in map to values. Note that this form requires all
        the keys to exist.

N.B. This syntax for processing maps has stablized but may change in
the future!

There is also an alternate short form map, mref, mset, mupd based on
the maclisp array reference forms. They take the same arguments as
there longer alternatives.
