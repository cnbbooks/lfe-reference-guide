# Maps

A map is:

```lisp
(map key value ... )
```

To access maps there are the following forms:

* Return the value associated with key in map:
```lisp
(map-get map key)
```
* Set keys in map to values:
```lisp
(map-set map key val ... )
```
* Update keys in map to values. Note that this form requires all the keys
  to exist:
```lisp
(map-update map key val ... )
```

**NOTE**: This syntax for processing maps has stablized, but may change in
the future!

There is also an alternate short form map functions:
 * ``mref``
 * ``mset``
 * ``mupd``

These are based on the MACLISP array reference forms. They take the same 
arguments as their longer alternatives.
