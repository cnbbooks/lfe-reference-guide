# Module definition

```cl
(defmodule name
  (export (f 2) (g 1) ... )
  (export all)
  (import (from mod (f1 2) (f2 1) ... )
          (rename mod ((f1 2) sune) ((f2 1) kurt) ... ))
  (import (prefix mod mod-prefix))              - NYI
  (attr-1 value-1 value-2)
  ... )
```
There can be multiple ``export`` and ``import`` declarations within module
declaration. The ``(export all)`` declaration is allowed together with
other ``export`` declarations and overrides them. Other attributes which
are not recognised by the compiler are allowed and are simply passed
on to the module and can be accessed through ``module_info/0``/``module_info/1``.
